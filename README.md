## Abstract
From an extension of the last assignment, I was working on if AI can accurately generate kinky hair. For assignment 2 I will be using generative methods to figure if AI is really biased towards kinky hair or is it not good for generating any hair type. “While there are always differences from ethnic blending or genetic differences, hair types fall under three main ‘ethnic’ types: Asian, Caucasian and African/Caribbean”(1). Using these three types I concluded that using AI isn't really great with any race and wouldn't necessarily recommend it for hair ideas.

After assignment 1 i had an interesting time figuring out if AI can fully understand what 4c hair is and can it replicate what it truly looks like. But this made me think, can AI generate other ethnicities with different types of hair or is it biased towards specific ethnicities. In the past AI can generate types of hair but to my knowledge from my previous analysis it cant fully understand what it is to have kinky, straight or wavy hair differences. I'm here to challenge that theory and really see if it can or not. “While there are always differences from ethnic blending or genetic differences, hair types fall under three main ‘ethnic’ types: Asian, Caucasian and African/Caribbean”(1). My original plan was to focus on more ethnicities but after learning this I figured my results would still be accurate. “While each ethnicity brings its unique characteristics to the table, the universal language of hair care remains consistent. Whether curly, wavy, or straight, every strand deserves love, care, and understanding”(2). This is why it's important to show each type of hair for everybody and that AI shouldn't be biased against any type of hair.




## Methodology

For my process I began to use one of the free websites that I used last time. I thought it would be great since it's specifically for hairstyles and anyone can access it. The website asked for a hair pattern, inspired by, persona, hair length and angle. For each hair pattern I put in the hair type 1A to 4C and explained each one from straight to kinky. For the inspired prompt, I kept it in North America since that's not the main focus. For the persona prompt I chose either an asian woman, white woman, black woman and just a woman. Hair length i left it long and face angle front which are both the default. My first trial was with no specific ethnic just a woman that AI thinks what each hair type is. For the Asian women prompt I used the same text but only went up to 3a since “While straight hair is the most common hair type in East Asia, curly hair is not rare. It’s simply less prevalent due to the specific genetic  makeup of the majority of the population”(3).knowing these I wanted to show that they can have 3a hair just not the other types. For the white women hair types I went from 1a to 3c to show that they can have straight wavy and curly hair. And for black women's hair types I went from 2a to 4c. Straight hair isn't common and all and most of african hair has some type of volume or curl in it. For the second website I used another familiar one I used on the last project but this time I actually paid for it to see the different results of free and paid AI generators by using the same verbiage as both.

## Result and Future Work

After the first website generative AI i was really upset with how long it took compared to last time. I did 10 images for each hair type and it took all day for it to finally finish. I wasn't sure if it was because I overdid it or was the website just not working that well that day. For me the best result was when I asked for 1A to around 2C. After that i started to notice the website kind of drop in quality and was very hesitant to show results. Especially when dealing with black women's hair types. Two pictures wouldn't even come out and showed an error image which I had never seen before. For the second website surprisingly I did better after in the 3a to 4c. With the straight hair it focused on making the image look different instead of focusing on the actual hair type. As my final result I feel like I got tired of using generative AI machines which made me not sure if i want to continue again. I also wouldn't recommend using it for figuring hair types of any ethnicities.




## Conclusion


My concluding research is I can't really see anyone else using these methods for different hair types. I do feel like it's not just biased towards 4A to 4c hair types but isn't good for any hair type someone has. It could've been the websites but honestly i think the majority of the users that want to see hair types for different ethnicities wouldn't dig that deep enough and would probably just use google which is faster and more easy access.
